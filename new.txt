passing an function as an argument to another funciton 
we are not waiting for the call back to happen so this is how asynchoronous operation works 
what ever call back happens first that will be executed first
err is error that no such file or directory found 
asynchoronous is more faster than the synchronous programing 
set time out schedules the execution of a function callout 
if call stack is busy doing a funcion than all the other tasks ar paused
the webapi pushes it on the call back queue 
and then when the webapi is free than it will be printed out
